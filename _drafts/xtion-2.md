Today we got a new 3D Sensor.
The [ASUS Xtion2](https://www.asus.com/3D-Sensor/Xtion-2/).
Unfortunately it's not sold in Europe, so we had to order in Taiwan.
Took us 3 weeks from deciding to buy, to actually getting our hands on the hardware.
Mostly a problem of our own purchasing department though.

Compared to the older version it seems to be of much better quality.
